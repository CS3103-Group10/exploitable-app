# exploitable-app
A web application built to showcase some exploitable web application behaviour. Built in fulfillment of the CS3103 Project for Group 10 of AY20/21 Sem 1.

## Getting Started
To start, clone this repository and navigate to it from the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/CS3103-Group10/exploitable-app.git
cd exploitable-app
```

### 1. Starting the database
1. Install Postgresql:
   ```
   brew install postgresql
   ```

2. Start Postgresql:
   ```
   pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
   ```
   (Stop the postgresql service later with `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop`)
   (If there is an error here, run `ps -ef | grep postmaster | awk '{print $2}'` and `sudo kill <pid>` for the pid that is revealed.)

3. Create a database for the webapp:
   ```
   createdb farena
   ```

4. Connect to the database:
   ```
   psql farena
   ```

5. While in the psql shell, initialize the database with dummy data:
   ```
   \cd database
   \i init.sql
   ```

### 2. Starting the API server and Frontend
1. Install all dependencies for server and frontend:
   ```
   yarn && yarn install
   ```

2. Start the both the webapp and server concurrently:
   ```
   yarn run start
   ```
   (Dev note #1: This runs both ui and server on hot-reload. :+1:)
   (Dev note #2: You can run the server and ui separately using `yarn run server` and `yarn run ui` respectively.)

## Walkthrough for students
**WIP**

## Exploits / Answers
**WIP**

## Folder Structure
### `ui` folder
Contains source code for React Frontend Webapp.
**WIP**

### `server` folder
Contains source code for our Express API Server.

* `app.js` - Initializes Express server
* `index.js` - Entrypoint for server execution

#### `config` folder
Contains modules needed for database connection, etc.

#### `routes` folder
Contains `routes.js`  which dictates all API routes.

### `database` folder
Contains files related to the PostgreSQL database. In this case, it contains solely `init.sql` which is required to:
1. Create an user role for the API server to utilize.
2. Initializes the database with the schema and dummy data.
