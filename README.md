# exploitable-app

A web application built to showcase some exploitable web application behaviour. Built in fulfillment of the CS3103 Project for Group 10 of AY20/21 Sem 1.

## Getting Started

To start, clone this repository and navigate to it from the terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CS3103-Group10/exploitable-app.git
cd exploitable-app
```

### 1. Starting the database

Install Postgresql:

```sh
# mac:
brew install postgresql
# ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install postgresql
```

Start Postgresql:

```sh
# mac:
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
# ubuntu should be started by default
```

- Stop the postgresql service later with `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop`
- If there is an error here, run `ps -ef | grep postmaster | awk '{print $2}'` and `sudo kill <pid>` for the pid that is revealed

Create a database for the webapp:

```sh
# mac:
createdb farena
# linux, start psql shell as `postgres` user:
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Connect to the database:

```sh
# mac:
psql farena
# linux:
\c farena
```

While in the `psql` shell, initialize the database with dummy data:

```sh
# both:
\cd database
\i init.sql
```

### 2. Starting the backend API server

Navigate to the `/server` directory, and install all dependencies:

```sh
cd server
yarn
```

Run the server in dev mode with hot reload:

```sh
yarn dev
```

### 3. Starting the frontend client

Navigate to the `/client` directory, and install all dependencies:

```sh
cd client
yarn
```

Run the client in dev mode with hot reload:

```sh
yarn dev
```

**WIP**

## Folder structure

### `client` folder

Contains source code for the frontend client.

#### `src/pages`

- Where all the page routes are defined
- Follows page directory routing (refer to [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction))

#### `src/layouts`

- Contains layouts used for the whole app

#### `src/styles`

- Contains global CSS files

---

### `server` folder

Contains source code for our Express API Server.

#### `src/routes`

- Where all the API routes are defined

#### `src/services`

- Contains third party services like `psql` and `express`

---

### `database` folder

Contains files related to the PostgreSQL database. In this case, it contains solely `init.sql` which is required to:

1. Create an user role for the API server to utilize
2. Initializes the database with the schema and dummy data
